# CryptoCurrency Forecast

The following project consists of an analysis of data from three different cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, XRP and Ethereum), to detect price fluctuations and their possible reasons, followed by the creation of an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) algorithm which, by taking into consideration the trend of the prices per minute of the last two years, we are able to get a prediction of the future trend of behavior of said currencies.
